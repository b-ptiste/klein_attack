# klein_attack

This project was done in the course of **Arnab Roy** during my intership in Austria.

The goal of this project was to use the knowledge we have learned in class on a topic from a
research paper. This will allow us to confront a real problem of an advanced level. We will try
to implement an attack thanks to this paper to see that it doesnâ€™t work only theoretically but
that it is also effective in practice.

My subject for this project is to find a differential attack on KLEIN64 on the maximum of round.
For that we will first introduce and describe KLEIN. Then I will describe the properties that
were useful to me and the weaknesses that were found on KLEIN. Finally, I will explain how I
have done to attack KLEIN64 between 2 and 6 rounds.

Without going into details, KLEIN64 is a 64 bits block cipher. The attack consists in first finding
the lower nibbles. Thus, it is possible to find 32 bits with a differential attack. Then, the higher
nibbles can be recovered by brute force or by using a trick again, so we can also reduce the
complexity of this part. Thus, we will show that it is possible to have an $O(2^{24})$ attack for 5
rounds and $O(2^{30})$ for 6 rounds to fully recover the key.

# test

The key is generated randomly. You just have to run the `main.c` file.

* If you want to choose your own key modify : `key`
* If you want to chose the number of round from 2 to 6 modify : `ROUNDS_64` in klein64.h
